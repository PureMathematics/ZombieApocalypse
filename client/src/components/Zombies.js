      </Card>
      <Card>
        Zombie bodies are human bodies, but with changed properties. Nervous system seems to be lacking, and only motor control exists. Therefore, they do not feel pain. However, they can be killed by humans. Only damage to their body will stop them.

        Zombies tend to move at a slouch or limp. Their lack of coordination makes for an unsteady stride. The fastest have been observed to move at a rate of barely one step per 1.5 seconds. They take advantage of our tiredness.

        They have little hand-eye coordination due to their primitive brain functions. No one has ever observed a zombie jumping, either from one spot to another or simply up or down. Zombies who walk or fall into water  will more likely wander across the bottom until eventually dissolving. Therefore, swimming is also a key skill for the GT students.

        Their eyes are no different from than those of a normal human. They can spot prey at distances comparable to a human. Though you might think that mimicking their motions and adopting a shambling, awkward limp would confuse approaching zombies, this will FAIL.

        They have excellent sounding. Not only can they detect -- but also, they can determine its direction. However, zombies are attracted by any sounds, not just those made by living creatures.
