      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Many zombie guides recommend the possession of relatively inaccessible tools such as first aid kits, swiss army knives, guns, and battle axes. As a student however, you most likely will not be able to obtain these without taking considerable risk once an outbreak is already in progress. This section will show the different tools that you as a student will be able to obtain, and how to use them.
      </p>
      <h1>Necessary Tools</h1>
      <h2>Backpack</h2>
      <p>
        Luckily, a backpack is one of the most useful items in general for an apocalypse, and you as a student probably already have one. Carry this around at all times to store other supplies you need. Purses and duffel bags are less effective as they may limit your arm movement.
      </p>
      <h2>Water Bottle</h2>
      <p>
        Not much explanation needed. Fortunately, water sources are still active, so water in general is accessible.
